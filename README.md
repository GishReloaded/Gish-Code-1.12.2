# GishCode 1.12.2

This is a hacked modification for Minecraft Forge 1.12.2

## How to use compiled (`JAR`, `DLL`). Three ways to use:
- Using `JAR` as common Minecraft Forge mod (Copy `JAR` file in folder `mods`)
- Using `JAR` for inject in Minecraft Forge Client with help [JavaInjector]
- Using `DLL` for inject in Minecraft Forge Client with help any injector
